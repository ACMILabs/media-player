### To make this autorun at startup:

* Create a batch file called `media-player.bat` which is a text file that includes:

```batch

cd /Users/<username>/media-player-nuc
start "" "%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe" --login -i -c "source config.env && python media_player.py"
```

* Press the Windows button and type Run.
* In the Run dialog type: `shell:startup`
* Cut and paste the shortcut into this folder.

## Setup RabbitMQ user

There's a demo RabbitMQ server setup on our Ubuntu Server. It's setup to start the `rabbitmq-server` service at boot. I used this command to do that: `sudo update-rc.d rabbitmq-server defaults`, but to manually start/stop the server use: `sudo service rabbitmq-server stop/start/restart`

To setup a user:

* Create a new user `sudo rabbitmqctl add_user username password`
* Give it the permissions needed `sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions username ".*" ".*" ".*"` - where ".*" is all permissions for configuration/write/read.
* List the user permissions `sudo rabbitmqctl list_user_permissions username`

The address of the AMQP service is then: `amqp://username:password@172.16.80.105:5672//`

## Sample AMQP consumer

There's a sample consumer to see the output from the `mewdia_player.py` vlc http server, run it with: `python consumer.py`.

You'll need to have the config variables loaded: `source config.env`
