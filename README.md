Media player
============

A media player using Python to launch VLC.

Features:
* Downloads a playlist of videos (with optional subtitles) from XOS
* Posts playback & volume information to a broker

Monitoring:
* Includes a Prometheus client exporting playback & volume information

Error reporting:
* Posts exceptions and errors to Sentry

## Troubleshooting

When booting up for the first time:

* If you see the Balena loading image (a rounded cube), and don't see your device in Balena Cloud or XOS, then the media player probably doesn't have any internet access. Check the ethernet connection, and reboot the device.
* If you see the ACMI logo on a black background, then the device has access to the internet and is trying to download video files from XOS. Check the Balena Cloud logs to verify that it's downloading the files you expect, large files take a little while to download. Also verify that you can reach the [XOS playlist API](https://museumos-prod.acmi.net.au/api/playlists/1/).
* If a default video starts playing with the title ACMI Media Player, then your device is running correctly and can access both XOS & Balena. You can now configure your device to load the content you'd like.

## Deploying via Balena for both x86 and ARM

### x86

$ balena deploy appName --build --buildArg 'IS_X86=true'

### ARM

$ balena deploy appName

### Multiple balena remotes

Alternatively you can add multiple `balena` remotes to push to, so to add both the intel and arm applications the commands to run would be:

```bash
$ git remote set-url balena --push --add g_acmi_developer@git.balena-cloud.com:g_acmi_developer/s__media-player-pi-4.git

$ git remote set-url balena --push --add g_acmi_developer@git.balena-cloud.com:g_acmi_developer/e__media-player-x86.git
```

## Testing and linting

1. Build the development container `$ docker-compose up --build`
2. Run testing & linting: `$ docker exec -it mediaplayer make linttest`

## Installation on macOS

* Clone this repository.
* Install VLC `brew cask install vlc`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `mv config.tmpl.env config.env`
* Create a Playlist in XOS with resources.
* Edit the `config.env` to point to the ID of your Playlist in Django.
* Run `source config.env` to load environment variables.
* Turn on the http server: VLC > Preferences > http web interface > tick the box & set the password you saved to `config.env`.
* Run `python media_player.py`

## Installation on Windows

* Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
* In an admin PowerShell:
  * Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) package manager.
  * Install VLC `choco install vlc`
  * Install Python3 `choco install python`
* In Git Bash shell:
  * Clone this repository.
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * `mv config.tmpl.env config.env`
  * Create a Playlist in XOS with resources.
  * Edit the `config.env` to point to the ID of your Playlist in Django.
  * Run `source config.env` to load environment variables.
  * Turn on the http server: VLC > Preferences > http web interface > tick the box & set the password you saved to `config.env`.
  * Run `python media_player.py`

### To make this autorun at startup:

* Create a batch file called `media-player.bat` which is a text file that includes:

```batch
C:
cd /Users/<username>/media-player-nuc
start "" "%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe" --login -i -c "source config.env && python media_player.py"
```

* Right click on the batch file and create a shortcut.
* Press the Windows button and type Run.
* In the Run dialog type: `shell:startup`
* Cut and paste the shortcut into this folder.

## Setup RabbitMQ user

There's a demo RabbitMQ server setup on our Ubuntu Server. It's setup to start the `rabbitmq-server` service at boot. I used this command to do that: `sudo update-rc.d rabbitmq-server defaults`, but to manually start/stop the server use: `sudo service rabbitmq-server stop/start/restart`

To setup a user:

* Create a new user `sudo rabbitmqctl add_user username password`
* Give it the permissions needed `sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions username ".*" ".*" ".*"` - where ".*" is all permissions for configuration/write/read.
* List the user permissions `sudo rabbitmqctl list_user_permissions username`

The address of the AMQP service is then: `amqp://username:password@172.16.80.105:5672//`

## Sample AMQP consumer

There's a sample consumer to see the output from the `mewdia_player.py` vlc http server, run it with: `python consumer.py`.

You'll need to have the config variables loaded: `source config.env`
